# UNH Quantitative Valuation Model

This repository supports my skills in financial valuation and quantitative analysis through a comprehensive study of UnitedHealth Group (UNH).

## Files
•⁠  ⁠UNH Research: A detailed report analyzing UNH’s market, competitive landscape, financial performance, and valuation. It includes Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Monte Carlo simulations, Value at Risk (VaR), and peer multiples, estimating a target price of $426 (38% upside) with visualizations generated in Python.
•⁠  ⁠UNH Quantitative Valuation Model: Python script (using pandas, numpy, yfinance, seaborn) implementing Monte Carlo simulations, DCF, VaR, and multiples calculations to support the report’s findings.

## Purpose
This project evaluates whether UNH’s current stock price ($308.55 as of 03.07.2025) reflects its intrinsic value, considering growth drivers (e.g., Optum platform) and risks (e.g., regulatory challenges). It demonstrates my ability to perform asset valuation, risk assessment, and data analysis, skills relevant to portfolio management.
